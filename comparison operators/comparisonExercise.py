This is an exercise drill that you can try if you want to practice making
more Comparison operations.
'''

#1) Make a variable called a and set it to 4 compared to 5, using the == 
#operator. Print the variable.

a = (4 == 5)
print (a)

#2) Make a variable called b and set it to False compared to a, using the ==
#operator. Print the variable.

b = (False == a )
print (b)

#3) Make a variable called c and set it to 4 compared to 3, using the >
#operator. Print the variable.

c = (4 > 3)
print (c)

#4) Make a variable called d and set it to 4 compared to 3, using the <
#operator. Print the variable.

d = (4 < 3)
print (d)

#5) Make a variable called e and set it to 45 compared to 23, using the >=
#operator. Print the variable.

e = (45 >= 23)

#6) Make a variable called f and set it to 23 compared to 23, using the <=
#operator. Print the variable.

f = (23 <= 23)
print (f)

#7) Make an int variable called g, set to 4. Make a variable called h and set
#it to 9 compared to g, using the <= operator. Print the variable.

g = 4 
h = (9 <= g) 
print (h)
