#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = "Samantha" == "Samantha"
print (x)

x = "Samantha" == "samantha"
print (x)

x = "Samantha" == "Michael"
print (x)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

v = (4 == 5)
print (v)

b = (5 == 5)
print (b)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = (4 > 5)
print (y)

g = (6 > 3)
print (g)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

f = (9 < 5)
print (f)

e = (5 < 12)
print (e)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

r = (5 >= 3)
print(r)

w = (4 >= 4)
print (w)

c = (3 >= 4)
print (c)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = (5 <= 3)
print(d)

s = (4 <= 4)
print (s)

a = (3 <= 4)
print (a)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

x = 3<= 4 
print (x)

''' 
the common mistakes are misspelling variables, missing an operator, 
or missing data overall. The common mistake is capitalizing one comparison and 
not the other one. The comparison that I am showing here is that the common 
mistake for this one is forgetting the data on one side or the other.
