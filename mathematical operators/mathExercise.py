This is an exercise drill that you can try if you want to practice making
more Math operations.

#1) Make a variable named a that is set to 4 plus 4. And print the variable.

a= 4 + 4 
print (a)

#2) Make a variable named b that is set to 4 plus a. And print the variable

b = 4 + a 
print (b)

#3) Make a variable named c that is set to "This " plus "and That". And print
#the variable.

c = "This " + "That "
print (c)

#4) Make a variable named d that is set to c plus " and Those". And print the
#variable.

d = c + "and Those"
print (d)

#5) Make a variable named e that is set to 4 minus 3. And print the variable.

e = 4 - 3 
print (e)

#6) Make a variable named f that is set to e minus 1. And print the variable.

f = e - 1 
print (f)

#7) Make a variable named g that is set to 4 times 8. And print the variable.

g = 4 * 8 
print (g)

#8) Make a variable named h that is set to g times 2. And print the variable.

h = g * 2 
print (h)

#9) Make a variable named string that is set to "String " times 3. And print 
#the variable.

string = "String " * 3 
print (string)

#10) Make a variable named i that is set to 3 divided by 2. And print the 
#variable.

i = 3 / 2 
print (i)

#11) Make a variable named j that is set to i divided by 10. And print the 
#variable.

j = 1 / 10
print (j)

#12) Make a variable named k that is set to 10 modulo 7. And print the variable.

k = 10 % 7
print (k)

#13) Make a variable named m that is set to k modulo 2. And print the variable.

m = k % 2 
print (m)

#14) Make a variable named n that is set to 10 floor divided by 7. And print the
#variable.

n = 10 // 7 
print (n)

#15) Make a variable named o that is set to n floor divide by 2. And print the
#variable.

o = n // 2 
print (o)

#16) Make a variable named p that is set to 4 to the 3 power. And print the
#variable.

p = 4**3
print (p)

#17) Make a variable named q that is set to p to the 2 power. And print the
#variable.

q = p**2
print (q)
