This outline will help solidify concepts from the Mathematical Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = "name" + " your"
print (y) 

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 + 4 
print (x)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 - 3 
print (x)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 5.8 - 3.1
print (y)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 * 4 
print (x)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x = "Samantha " * 4 
print (x)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 / 4 
print (x)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 5.6 / 3.4 
print (y)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 5 % 4 
print (x)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 // 4 
print (x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 2**2
print (x)

y = 2**3
print (y)

z = 2**4
print(z)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

string = "Samantha"
print ("This is " + string )

The common mistake we make is misspelling variables or missing the operator
