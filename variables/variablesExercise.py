#22) Make a list named listTwo, set to ["string", "string", "string"]. And print
#the list.

listTwo = ["string", "string","string"]
print (listTwo)

#23) Make a list named subList, set to the first three items of listOne. USE
#INDEXES. And print the list.

subList = (listOne[0], listOne[1], listOne [2])
print (subList) 

#24) Make a list named newList, set to listTwo. And print the list.

newList = listTwo
print (newList)

#25) Make a list named boolean, set to [True, False, True, False]. And print the
#list.
