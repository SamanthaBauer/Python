#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a = 5
a = 4
a = 5
a = 3

#Float

a = 3.45
a = 2.1

#String

a = "string"
a = "Samantha and Michael"

#Boolean

a = True 
a = False 

#list

a = [3, 4, 5, 6]

a = ["stringOne", "stringTwo"]

a = [True, False, True]

a = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2

print (vara)

print (a)

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

var = 4
var = "string"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

varTwo = var
print(varTwo)

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

b = [a, varA, var]

list = ["a", "b","c"]

print (list)
print (list [0])

listVar = list[0]
print(listVar)

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:

string = "samantha" 

print (string[0])

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print (5)
print("string")
print (True)
print (list)
print(string)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
 
name = "samantha"

'''
typically the error would be adding two equal signs
